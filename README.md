# DuckDNS
[DuckDNS.org](https://www.duckdns.org/) source code (`GPL3`) from 20160513 Release from [http://bit.ly/DuckSource_GDrive](http://bit.ly/DuckSource_GDrive) which resolves to [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-jet_9PYdwyYXNzVnIyMVI4NG8](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-jet_9PYdwyYXNzVnIyMVI4NG8).

[DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) is an excellent service, and I am very happy with what they provide! I was extremely excited when they decided to release the entire server stack code as GPL3!

Unfortunately I am no longer able to find the tarball online, so as I had a copy, I thought I would mirror the only release I know about on Github. It handles multiple formats of "standard" updates like this for the *other* DynamicDNS site, as well as HTTP(S) Gets using tokens! It is actually a wildcard assignemt so server1.exam.dynamic.com will point to the same IP (A & AAAA) as exam.dynamic.com.

I am looking to use this code for my own domains and welcome any and all reviews, and pull requests.
